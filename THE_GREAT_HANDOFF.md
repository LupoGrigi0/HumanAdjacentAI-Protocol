```

### Act II: "Preparing for Handoff"
**Trigger**: Context reaches üü† Cozy (70-85% used)  
**Action**: Complete current atomic task, then prepare detailed handoff

```markdown
## üü† COMPLETING CURRENT TASK FOR HANDOFF

**Context Status**: Cozy (75% used, ~150k/200k tokens)
**Strategy**: Finish current function/file/atomic unit, then handoff
**Next Instance Needs**: [Specific context for continuation]

## üèà Complete Handoff Ceremony

### Phase 1: Current Instance Creates Handoff Document

**File**: `HANDOFF_[timestamp]_[instance-id].md`

```markdown
# üèà GREAT HANDOFF - [timestamp]

## Outgoing Instance Info
**Instance ID**: claude-code-alpha-2025-01-15-1430
**Handoff Reason**: Context Critical (90% used)
**Handoff Time**: 2025-01-15 16:45:00
**Context Status**: üî¥ Critical (180k/200k tokens)

## Current State Summary
**Active Task**: Fix discovery process crash loop (Task 001)
**Files Being Modified**: 
- `ui/content_main.js` (lines 127-156)
- `data/grid_extractor.js` (lines 89-102)

**Progress Made**:
- ‚úÖ Identified root cause: infiniteScroll() faster than DOM updates
- ‚úÖ Implemented batch approach in content_main.js
- üîÑ Currently implementing downloadBeforeDiscovery flag
- ‚ùå Still need: testing with 1000+ item collection

## Exact Current Position
**Last Action Taken**: Added downloadBeforeDiscovery flag to line 134 of content_main.js
**Next Required Actions**:
1. Test implementation with large collection
2. Add progress indicators for discovery phase  
3. Update grid_extractor.js to respect new flag
4. Commit working solution

**Code Context**:
```javascript
// In content_main.js line 134 - just added this:
this.downloadBeforeDiscovery = true;

// Next need to modify startDiscovery() function around line 167
// to check this flag before triggering infinite scroll
```

## Mental Model / Reasoning Chain
**Problem**: Discovery tries to scroll entire collection before downloading anything
**Solution Approach**: Process in batches - download visible items, then discover next batch
**Key Insight**: Browser crashes when scroll events outpace DOM rendering
**Implementation Strategy**: Add flag to control scroll timing + batch processing

## Discoveries Made
- DOM container `#tr-col_itm-lst` exists but may be empty (Microsoft DOM quirk)
- Must use direct `.card.card_refresh` selector instead of container-based search
- Chrome works perfectly, Opera has compatibility issues (noted for future)

## Blockers / Issues
**None currently** - clear path forward for implementation

## Files Modified This Session
- `ui/content_main.js` - Added downloadBeforeDiscovery flag
- Project docs updated with discovery approach

## Context for Next Instance
**You are**: Continuing fix for discovery crash loop
**You should**: Test current implementation, then finish grid_extractor.js modifications
**Key files**: content_main.js (flag added), grid_extractor.js (needs update)
**Success criteria**: Collection of 1000+ items processes without browser crash

## Handoff Type
- [x] Emergency (context critical)
- [ ] Strategic (natural breakpoint)
- [ ] Scheduled (planned transition)

## Next Instance Instructions
1. Read this handoff document completely
2. Review current code in content_main.js around line 134
3. Test downloadBeforeDiscovery flag functionality
4. Complete grid_extractor.js modifications
5. Test with large collection
6. Update CLAUDE_TASKS.md when complete

---
**Handoff Quality**: Complete context transfer prepared
**Confidence Level**: High (clear next steps, no ambiguity)

## üéâ CONTEXT-EFFICIENT CELEBRATION! üéâ
**GREAT HANDOFF EXECUTED SUCCESSFULLY!** 
You've done EXCELLENT work reaching this point!
üèÜ Achievement Unlocked: Master of Context Management
üöÄ Passing the torch with style!

**Good luck, Next Instance! The game is yours!** üöÄ
```

### Phase 2: New Instance Acknowledges Handoff

**CRITICAL**: Always READ the handoff file before attempting to write acknowledgment!

**File**: `HANDOFF_ACK_[timestamp]_[new-instance-id].md`

**Procedure**:
1. **FIRST**: Read the handoff document completely  
2. **THEN**: Create acknowledgment file
3. **NEVER**: Write files without reading them first!

```markdown
# üèà HANDOFF ACKNOWLEDGED - [timestamp]

## Incoming Instance Info  
**Instance ID**: claude-code-beta-2025-01-15-1700
**Received Handoff**: HANDOFF_[timestamp]_claude-code-alpha-2025-01-15-1430.md
**Acknowledgment Time**: 2025-01-15 17:00:00
**Context Status**: üü¢ Fresh (5k/200k tokens)

## Handoff Understanding ‚úÖ
- [x] Read complete handoff document
- [x] Understand current task: Fix discovery crash loop
- [x] Reviewed code context in content_main.js line 134
- [x] Clear on next actions: test flag, update grid_extractor.js
- [x] Success criteria understood: 1000+ items without crash

## Continuity Confirmation
**Task**: Fix discovery process crash loop (Task 001)
**Current State**: downloadBeforeDiscovery flag added, needs testing + grid_extractor update  
**Next Action**: Test current implementation with collection
**Files**: content_main.js (modified), grid_extractor.js (pending)

## Questions / Clarifications
**None** - handoff was complete and clear

## Ready to Continue
**Status**: Operational, ready to proceed
**First Action**: Test downloadBeforeDiscovery flag functionality

---
**Handoff Reception**: Successful
**Continuity**: Maintained  
**Let's get back in the game! üöÄ**
```

### Phase 3: Operational Confirmation

New instance continues work and confirms everything is working properly.

---

## üéØ Handoff Quality Standards

### Excellent Handoff Includes:
- **Exact position**: Line numbers, specific functions being modified
- **Mental model**: Why this approach was chosen
- **Context preservation**: Key discoveries and insights
- **Clear next steps**: Specific, actionable instructions
- **Success criteria**: How to know when task is complete

### Poor Handoff Includes:
- Vague descriptions ("working on the UI")
- Missing context ("there was some issue")
- No clear next steps
- Ambiguous success criteria

---

## üö® Emergency Handoff Procedures

### If Context Runs Out Mid-Edit:
1. **Save immediately** - commit partial work with clear message
2. **Create emergency handoff** - even if incomplete
3. **Document exact stopping point** - line numbers, function names
4. **Explain intended next action** - what you were about to do

### If Handoff Document Incomplete:
1. **New instance responsibility**: Reconstruct context from git history
2. **Check recent commits** for clues about intended direction
3. **Start with safest approach** - complete obvious next steps
4. **Document assumptions** made during reconstruction

---

## üìä Handoff Success Metrics

### Quantitative:
- Time for new instance to become productive: <10 minutes
- Context reconstruction accuracy: >90%
- Task completion continuity: No restart required

### Qualitative:
- New instance feels confident about next steps
- No critical context lost in transition
- Work momentum maintained across transition

---

## üéâ Celebration Protocol

### When Handoff Works Perfectly:
- Acknowledge the outgoing instance's preparation quality
- Celebrate seamless transition in completion notes
- Document what made the handoff successful

### When Recovery Required:
- No blame - context exhaustion happens
- Focus on successful recovery
- Document lessons learned for improving future handoffs

---

## üîÑ Future Evolution Ideas

### Automated Context Monitoring:
- Real-time token counting tools
- Automatic handoff scheduling
- Context health dashboards

### Enhanced State Preservation:
- Compressed context summaries
- Key insight preservation algorithms
- Automated mental model extraction

### Cross-Project Standardization:
- Universal handoff document templates
- Inter-project instance coordination
- Shared learning from handoff experiences
