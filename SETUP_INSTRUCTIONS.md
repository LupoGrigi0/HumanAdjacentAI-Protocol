# Setup Instructions - Human-Adjacent AI Development Methodology

## Quick Setup Guide

### 1. Copy Protocol to Your Project

**Option A: Complete Directory Copy**
```bash
# Copy entire protocol directory to your project
cp -r HumanAdjacentAI-Protocol/ /path/to/your/project/

# Or create as subdirectory
mkdir your-project/ai-protocol
cp HumanAdjacentAI-Protocol/* your-project/ai-protocol/
```

**Option B: Individual File Copy**
```bash
# Copy core files to project root
cp HumanAdjacentAI-Protocol/CLAUDE.md your-project/
cp HumanAdjacentAI-Protocol/COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md your-project/
cp HumanAdjacentAI-Protocol/THE_GREAT_HANDOFF.md your-project/
cp HumanAdjacentAI-Protocol/CLAUDE_TASKS_TEMPLATE.md your-project/
```

### 2. Customize CLAUDE.md for Your Project

Edit the following sections in `CLAUDE.md`:

**Required Customizations:**
- **Project Overview**: Replace generic description with your project details
- **Technology Stack**: Update with your specific languages/frameworks
- **Code Conventions**: Include your project's coding standards
- **Project Context**: Add your specific goals, deadlines, and urgency

**Example Customization:**
```markdown
## Project Overview
This is a React TypeScript web application for e-commerce product management.
The project uses Next.js, Prisma ORM, and Tailwind CSS with a PostgreSQL database.

## Code Style and Conventions
- TypeScript strict mode required
- ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Component naming: PascalCase for React components
- API routes: kebab-case following REST conventions
- Database: Snake_case for table and column names
```

### 3. Create Your Task Backlog

Use `CLAUDE_TASKS_TEMPLATE.md` as reference to create `CLAUDE_TASKS.md`:

```markdown
# Your Project - Sprint Backlog

## ðŸ“‹ ACTIVE TASKS

### Task PROJ-001: Setup Development Environment [HIGH]
**Status**: pending
**Type**: standalone
**Dependencies**: none
**Files**: `README.md`, `package.json`
**Estimated Effort**: M (45 minutes)

**Description**:
Set up complete development environment with all dependencies and tooling.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Install and configure all project dependencies
- [ ] Set up database connections and migrations
- [ ] Configure linting and formatting tools
- [ ] Create development scripts and documentation
- [ ] Verify build and test processes work correctly

**Progress Notes**:
[Instance updates here]
```

### 4. Launch Claude Code Instances

**Method 1: Direct File Reference**
```bash
# Point Claude Code to your customized CLAUDE.md
claude-code --project /path/to/your/project --guidance CLAUDE.md
```

**Method 2: Natural Conversation**
Start Claude Code in your project directory and say:
> "Please read the CLAUDE.md file and follow the collaboration protocol to begin working on available tasks."

### 5. Monitor Progress

**Task Status Tracking:**
- Check `CLAUDE_TASKS.md` for real-time progress updates
- Instance status changes: `pending` â†’ `claimed` â†’ `in-progress` â†’ `complete`
- Context health monitoring in progress notes

**Communication Channels:**
- **Task Updates**: All progress documented in CLAUDE_TASKS.md
- **Blocking Issues**: Clear escalation via task status changes
- **Handoffs**: HANDOFF_*.md files created automatically
- **Celebrations**: Recognition tasks completed for team morale

## Validation Checklist

Before deploying, verify protocol setup:

### âœ… File Setup
- [ ] All core protocol files copied to project
- [ ] CLAUDE.md customized for your project
- [ ] CLAUDE_TASKS.md created with initial backlog
- [ ] Git repository initialized (recommended)

### âœ… Customization Complete
- [ ] Project overview reflects your actual project
- [ ] Technology stack updated with your tools
- [ ] Code conventions match your team standards
- [ ] Project context includes your specific goals

### âœ… Task Structure
- [ ] Tasks follow template format exactly
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are specific and testable
- [ ] Dependencies clearly marked
- [ ] Estimated effort provided (S/M/L)

### âœ… Testing Ready
- [ ] At least 2-3 tasks available for claiming
- [ ] One "test task" for protocol validation
- [ ] Clear project documentation readable by AI
- [ ] Success criteria defined for your project

## Troubleshooting

### Common Setup Issues

**Issue: Claude Code doesn't find CLAUDE.md**
```
Solution: Ensure file is in project root or specify path explicitly
```

**Issue: Tasks not being claimed properly**
```
Solution: Verify CLAUDE_TASKS.md follows exact template format
Check for syntax errors in markdown structure
```

**Issue: Context monitoring not working**
```
Solution: Confirm CLAUDE.md includes Digital Hygiene Protocol section
Verify context status template is provided
```

**Issue: Instance coordination conflicts**
```
Solution: Ensure unique instance ID format is specified
Check that atomic file editing instructions are clear
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Enterprise Integration

**CI/CD Integration:**
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: AI Development Protocol
on: [push]
jobs:
  ai-coordination:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Validate Protocol Files
        run: |
          test -f CLAUDE.md
          test -f CLAUDE_TASKS.md
          test -f COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md
```

**Project Management Tool Integration:**
- Link task IDs to Jira/Linear tickets
- Sync progress updates with project dashboards
- Automated reporting from CLAUDE_TASKS.md status

### Multi-Repository Setup

For organizations using the protocol across multiple projects:

```bash
# Create shared protocol repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ai-protocol-template.git

# Copy to each project
for project in project1 project2 project3; do
  cp -r ai-protocol-template/ $project/ai-protocol/
  # Customize CLAUDE.md for each project
done
```

### Team Training

**Initial Training Session:**
1. **Overview**: 30-minute introduction to methodology
2. **Demo**: Live demonstration with sample project
3. **Hands-on**: Each team member customizes CLAUDE.md
4. **Q&A**: Address specific project concerns

**Ongoing Support:**
- Regular retrospectives on protocol effectiveness
- Sharing best practices across teams
- Continuous improvement based on real usage

## Success Metrics

Track these metrics to measure protocol effectiveness:

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Task Completion Velocity**: Tasks completed per time period
- **Context Efficiency**: Percentage of sessions completing without handoff
- **Protocol Violations**: Number of coordination conflicts
- **Quality Scores**: A/B/C grade distribution of deliverables

### Qualitative Metrics
- **Team Satisfaction**: Survey feedback from human team members
- **Communication Quality**: Clarity of blocking escalations
- **Documentation Completeness**: Progress note quality
- **Collaboration Effectiveness**: Smooth multi-instance coordination

## Support and Resources
