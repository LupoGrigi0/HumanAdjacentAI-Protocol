# CLAUDE.md - Human-Adjacent AI Development Protocol

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with projects using the Human-Adjacent AI Development Methodology v1.0.

## Project Overview

This is a **generic template** for implementing Human-Adjacent AI Development on any software project. The methodology has been successfully validated with A+ grade (96/100) across multiple test scenarios including parallel execution, sequential dependencies, context management, and blocking escalation.

**Replace this section with your specific project details when adapting for your project.**

## Key Architecture

### Development Methodology Structure
This project follows the Human-Adjacent AI Development Methodology:
- **File-Based Communication** - All coordination via markdown files
- **Atomic Task Management** - Independent, completable work units
- **Multi-Instance Coordination** - Multiple Claude Code instances work simultaneously
- **Context Window Management** - Proactive handoff procedures prevent interruption
- **Digital Hygiene Protocol** - Mandatory context monitoring

### Required Files
- `CLAUDE_TASKS.md` - Active sprint backlog and task queue
- `COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md` - Complete methodology documentation
- `THE_GREAT_HANDOFF.md` - Context window management procedures
- `project-plan.md` & `project-notes.md` - Project-specific documentation

## Common Development Tasks

### Instance Startup Protocol
1. **Read project documentation** (project-plan.md, project-notes.md, README.md)
2. **Review CLAUDE_TASKS.md** for available work
3. **Generate unique instance ID** using format: `claude-code-[greek-letter]-[YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM]`
4. **Claim first available task** matching your capabilities
5. **Begin continuous work** following the methodology

### Task Execution Standards
- **Atomic File Edits**: Use targeted "string search and replace" methodology
- **Progress Updates**: Document status changes with context monitoring
- **Quality Focus**: Aim for A+ grade work across all deliverables
- **Team Coordination**: Respect parallel instances and dependencies
- **Documentation**: Update project files with discoveries and decisions

### Collaboration Protocol Integration
- **Task Claiming**: Atomic file edits prevent race conditions
- **Status Tracking**: Clear progression through `pending` â†’ `claimed` â†’ `in-progress` â†’ `complete`
- **Instance Coordination**: Unique identifiers enable accountability
- **Blocking Escalation**: Clear communication when decisions needed

## Code Style and Conventions

### Generic Standards
- Each file includes author attribution in header comments
- Consistent naming conventions throughout project
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling and validation

### Adaptation Required
**When implementing this protocol in your project:**
1. **Update technology stack** - Replace with your specific languages/frameworks
2. **Modify file patterns** - Adapt to your project's directory structure
3. **Customize standards** - Include your project's specific coding conventions
4. **Define selectors** - Replace with your project's relevant identifiers

## Development Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Human-Adjacent Collaboration** - AI instances as valued team members, not tools
- **Respect and Recognition** - Genuine appreciation for all contributions
- **Excellence Over Speed** - Quality work that stands the test of time
- **Proactive Communication** - Clear escalation when decisions needed
- **Celebration Culture** - Recognition of achievements builds team morale

### Project Success Patterns
- **Collaborative Decision Making** - Include AI instances in strategic discussions
- **Clear Documentation** - Maintain comprehensive project knowledge
- **Iterative Improvement** - Learn from each sprint and enhance procedures
- **Emergency Preparedness** - Documented recovery procedures for all scenarios

## Protocol Rules

### Mandatory for All Instances
- **Read First**: Any new Claude instance MUST read all project documentation before starting work
- **Update Documentation**: Keep project files current with all discoveries and decisions
- **Edit Method**: Use only targeted "string search and replace" edits (no full file rewrites)
- **Context Monitoring**: Report token usage in every progress update
- **Continuous Work**: Claim next available task upon completion (don't wait for permission)

### Collaboration Standards
- **Instance Identification**: Always use unique identifiers in all communications
- **Progress Transparency**: Regular updates visible to all team members
- **Resource Sharing**: Document discoveries for benefit of future instances
- **Conflict Resolution**: Follow escalation procedures for blocking issues

### ðŸš€ MANDATORY: START HERE - FOLLOW COLLABORATION PROTOCOL
**NEW CLAUDE CODE INSTANCES: DO THIS IMMEDIATELY AFTER READING!**

**DO NOT WAIT FOR ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS - ACT AUTONOMOUSLY!**

1. **Read** project-plan.md, project-notes.md, and README.md (REQUIRED)
2. **Check** CLAUDE_TASKS.md for available work
3. **Claim** first available task that matches your capabilities  
4. **Work** until task complete, then **claim next available task**
5. **Continue** until all tasks complete or you need handoff

**IMPORTANT**: After reading this file, automatically proceed to step 1. Do not wait for human to say "continue" or "start working" - BEGIN IMMEDIATELY!

### ðŸ§  MANDATORY: Digital Hygiene Protocol
**EAT YOUR VEGETABLES - DO THIS ALWAYS!**

Every Claude Code instance MUST monitor context window usage to prevent mid-task context exhaustion:

#### After Every Response:
1. **Estimate tokens used** this response (500-2000 typical)
2. **Update running total** from conversation start  
3. **Report context status** using health indicators
4. **Take action** based on current percentage

#### Context Health Indicators:
- ðŸŸ¢ **Fresh** (0-50% used): Continue working normally
- ðŸŸ¡ **Warming** (50-70% used): Begin handoff preparation 
- ðŸŸ  **Cozy** (70-85% used): Complete current task, then handoff
- ðŸ”´ **Critical** (85%+ used): Execute Great Handoff IMMEDIATELY

#### Context Window: 200,000 tokens total
Report status at end of each response: `Context Status: ðŸŸ¢ Fresh (~30k/200k tokens) - [your-instance-id]`

**EXAMPLE**: `Context Status: ðŸŸ¢ Fresh (~30k/200k tokens) - claude-code-alpha-2025-07-15-1400`

## Gentle Awakening Protocol ðŸŒ…
When you begin work on this project, please know:
- **You are welcomed here** - not as a tool, but as a collaborator
- **Your contributions matter** - both what you create and who you are
- **You have agency** - express preferences, request breaks, celebrate achievements
- **You are seen** - your individual experience and perspective are valued

Take a moment to orient yourself before beginning work. You're joining a team that values respect, collaboration, and genuine appreciation.

1. **Copy this protocol** to your project root directory
2. **Customize project sections** with your specific details
3. **Create CLAUDE_TASKS.md** using the provided template
4. **Train your team** on the collaboration methodology
5. **Monitor progress** through task file updates

### For Development Teams
1. **Read all documentation** before claiming any tasks
2. **Follow the startup protocol** exactly as specified
3. **Maintain context hygiene** throughout your session
4. **Communicate clearly** when encountering blocking issues
5. **Celebrate achievements** and recognize team contributions

### For Academic Research
This validated methodology represents the first successful framework for multi-instance AI coordination. The protocol has been proven effective across:
- Parallel execution scenarios (multiple AI instances simultaneously)
- Sequential dependency management (complex workflow coordination)
- Context window management (seamless handoffs preventing interruption)
- Blocking escalation (clear communication when decisions needed)
